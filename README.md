# resume-reload
An assertive resume application that makes sure you're updating your resume every so often.

Ever go to update your resume and realize that you have forgotten all of the great things you've done since doing so last time? It is a well known problem that resumes are only ever updated when you need to go hunting for a job. This process is not one (hopefully) that you do too often, so, here is the resume reload.

This application **plans** to leverage **twilio** and **watson conversation** to update your resume for you. Too much gets lost when it's time to write those bullets. Don't let all the hard work you've done be lost to the constant flow of attrition.

### TODOs
This project leverages **zenhub**, an awesome project planning tool that relies on Github issues to manage projects. Therefore any improvements to be made a listed there.
